1.  Please test your solutions with random floppy interrupts.  
    The interrupts will always arrive at the same time, the
	simulator runs in deterministic mode.  If you answer yes
	when emacsim prompts you, and if you provide a seed, 
	then the interrupts will arrive randomly.  If you run
	into problems, please rerun emacsim with the random
	interrupts and the same seed.


2. Elevator Algorithm Test: 

Please copy 

  termin0.disk to termin0 
  termin1.disk to termin1
  termin2.disk to termin2 
  termin3.disk to termin3 
  termin4.disk to termin4 


3. Semaphore Test:

Please copy:
 
  termin0.sem to termin0
  termin1.sem to termin1

Please do not test termin3/termin4 together with termin0.sem/termin1.sem.
The reason is that these four tprocesses are all trying to use Segment 2 
for synchronization.
